Core functionnalities of the finance app.

VISION

1) Existing products exist that are quite similar in features to this application. The main ones are these
    - TradingView
    - SeekingAlpha
    - FinViz
    - Ycharts
    - Bloomberg Terminal


What separates this app
    - Possibility for users to modify/create data. This means that errors can be spotted if they come from automatic imports and it also means that very specific/custom data can be saved/used. Example: net retention rate, daus, maus, arpu, fed funds rate, brokerage interest rates, etc.
    - User interactions will make it so users can notify certain others when new data is added or when they want to share an idea
        -> you can also interact in bberg erminal, but very expensive
    - Dynamic/simulation portfolios creation is available in other apps, but there is no margin analysis/trade filtering through margin (trade filtering = I have 10 ideas for a trade, which one is best considering my available margin)
    - User can save his own trade logs and reports will be generated from that. Tax reports (based on country), pnl, pnl by instruments, stocks, by periods, etc.
    - Service is very cheap and free tier is quite compelling, but many add ons
    - Analysts are a big part of the app and can interact with their subscribed users easily (ideas, models that can be used by clients for valuations, custom metrics, etc.)
    - Companies can be separated/screened/valued by business segments. (aws, google cloud, youtube , etc.)

what this app will not do:
    - charting. too many good products for this out there

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TradingView

    - screener
    - best charting
    - pine script that lets users program their own scripts for screening/technical analysis
    - very nice ui

    - no custom filters
    - data is fixed because it comes from them/automatic data imports. so, not all data available + delay + errors possible

FinViz
    - very good screener
    - lots of filters
    - free tier is decent
    - user can create portfolios
    - custom date ranges for filters, but data goes back 

    - no custom filters
    - data is fixed because it comes from them/automatic data imports. so, not all data available + delay + errors possible
    - ugly ui

SeekingAlpha
    - good screener
    - ratings by authors for stocks (a bit like analysts)
